Project to implement a simple LC2K processor in SystemVerilog.

Verilog tasks:
- [x] Implementing single cycle datapath
- [x] Implementing pipeline datapath
- [ ] Implementing Control FSM
- [ ] Implementing a cache
- [ ] Implementing a branch predictor
- [ ] Testing

- [x] Implementing PC
- [x] Implementing ALU
- [x] Implementing Register File
- [x] Implementing Memory


Based primarily on descriptions from Dan Liu's course notes. 
I did the datapath work for the JALR command.
